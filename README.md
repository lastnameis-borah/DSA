## Complexity

It basically means the time taken for a particular operation to be completed. So, for that we can time the code to tell us how long it took (**runtime**).</br>
</br>
But, this will vary depending on the programming language and the computer you're working with.</br>
</br>
That's why use something more abstract (than runtime) called **time complexity**.
